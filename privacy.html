Effective Date: January 1, 2026

Clarity Tools Australia (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to maintaining transparency and protecting user privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when users interact with our applications, websites, and related services, including our game Margin.

We do not collect sensitive health data, financial information, biometric data, government identification numbers, precise location data, or private messages beyond what is voluntarily submitted in forms.

2. Name Collection

When a user submits their name via a form, that name is used solely to respond to inquiries or provide support. We do not sell, rent, or share names with unrelated third parties for marketing purposes.

Names are stored securely and retained only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill communication purposes.

• Device type
• Operating system
• App version

Analytics data does not directly identify individuals. It is aggregated and used solely to improve functionality, stability, and user experience.

Our applications may display advertisements. Advertising partners may collect limited device-related information to provide relevant ads. This may include:

• Device identifiers
• General location data (not precise)

All partners are required to implement appropriate safeguards.

8. Data Retention

Names submitted through forms are retained only as long as necessary to respond to the inquiry.

Analytics and advertising data may be retained in aggregated form for performance monitoring and reporting purposes.

9. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. While no system can guarantee absolute security, we take appropriate steps to safeguard information.
